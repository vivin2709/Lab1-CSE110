Today I reviewed the following git commands, I hope I keep learning more of these:

```
git status
git add
git commit
git checkout 
git push 
```

I also learned how to VS Code UI. Which is super exciting for me as a budding programmer and also why VS Code is my favorite IDE. I started using it for CSE11. I also like using IntelliJ and was informed about its utility at my summer Internship. 

This is the company I interned at: [https://www.radianmobility.com]

My aims for myself as a successful software engineer:
- [ ] Understand the realities of working in a diverse team 
- [ ] Focus more on the iterative process of development than short term results
- [ ] Make mistakes and learn from them
